The Historic Center of Mexico City is one of the most important tourist places in the country.
In that place different stages of the history of the city and the country converge, from
Pre-Columbian age to modern Mexico.

There are many activities and places to visit like museums, concerts, restaurants,
colonial churches, including archaeological sites. So it is possible to lose yourself in a world
of activities.This project offers a small guide to visit those beautiful places for tourists
with little limited.

We need to start somewhere, so one of the most iconic points of interest is the Zocalo.
From that point, it is possible to move to different historical buildings, museums, restaurants,
shops etc. In this place we need the data of the nearby places, such as coordinates, direction, etc.
Since then, Mexico City is the city with the most museums in the world, we began to search
museums near the Zocalo on the Foursquare platform.

We assumed that a tourist chose one of the most representative museums and the archaeological zone.
in Mexico: main museum of the temple. From there, we look for trending places to visit, eat or just
chill out. Therefore, we look for places near a certain place and we need to draw them on a map.
